            <p>This project aims to explore the usage of vocabularies that foster a sense of unification throughout the early stages of the Cold War.
                Specifically, it aims to answer the questions of whether the escalation of Cold War and the occupational distribution of the region was was reflected by the usage of vocabularies.
                Case studies will be conducted on the U.S. Census Bureau - designated regions, with both qualitative and quantitative analysis on the collected data, in order to assess the intuitive
                hypothesis that the sense of unification fostered by the newspaper will be reflected by the increase in number of people engaging in public administrations.
                This project will conclude with answers to above questions, as well as a compare-and-contrast to the answers provided by a generative AI.

        <p style="text-indent: 25px">The Cold War, starting from 1947 and ending in 1991, is often regarded as the most pivotal moment of shaping the modern society. In the time of such heightened tension, unification among citizens is a critical factor,
            which is often fostered through media outlets such as newspapers. Particularly, the linguistic choices used in these newspapers was the major device for conveying messages, varying
            according to the demographic details of the region of publication. In want of 
            a closer inspection on whether the United States (U.S.) newspaper publications had adopted this method, 
            this project aims to explore and analyze the usage of vocabularies that foster a sense of unification and their regional differences, specifically the population engaged in public administration.
            The project hopes to determine methods used by the U.S. newspaper for intra-national connection throughout the early stages of Cold War.

        <p>The figures above show the occupational distribution of four regions, during 1940s. It can be seen that the distributions are distinct; Majority of people in the North Central and Northeast are engaged in
            Manufacturing, while people in the South were rather engaged in agriculture, while the West is more inclined towards wholesale and retail.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>The figures above show the occupational distribution of four regions during 1950s. The percentage of people engaged in manufacturing have been increased for the North Central and the Northeast, while more people are engaged in
            wholesale and retail in the South and the West. As 3 out of 4 regions (except the West) are having more percentage of people engaging in transportation-related occupations, the increase in wholesale and retail, and manufacturing
            could be due to the fact that more people have chosen to engage in jobs that are away from their location of living with the benefits of public transportation.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">1960s</h3>

        </div>
        <p>The figures above show the occpational distribution of four regions during 1960s. For all regions, wholesale and retail related services as well as manufacturing related services have became the major occupation.
            It is interesting to see how the professional related jobs have also increased for all four reasons significantly, which could be due to the arms race between U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold War.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Government (Public Administration) Occupation</h3>
        <div class="grid-container">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>It should be noted that the military related occupations constitute the majority of the public administration. From the figures, it can be seen that four all regions, the population of people engaging in public administration
            increased over time, rather in a linear manner. The West experienced the highest increase, with 37.2% from 1940s to 1950s, and 33.5% from 1950s to 1960s. The Northeastern was the least, with 24.2% and 16.1%. However, this could be
            due to the fact that the total population of public administration in the West is the smallest, leading to a small sample bias.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Important Getaways</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturing, wholesale and retail, agriculture, and professional related jobs constituted the majority of occupation from 1940s to 1960s in the U.S.</li>
            <li>Population increase for some occpations could be due to the technological advancements, or the escalation of the Cold War.</li>
            <li>Population of people engaging in public administration increased in a linear manner for all regions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Analysis by Regions</h2>
        <p>For the analysis of each region, the optical character recognition (OCR, automated text transfer) generated U.S. newspapers published between 1940 and 1960, divided by the regions, were collected.
            The extracted vocabularies from the data were then filtered using Named Entity Recognition - which is extracting 'important' terms from linguistic strings - feature of SpaCy, an open-source Natural Language Processing tool. 
            For identifying the vocabularies that were used to foster a sense of unification, thesauruses as well as manual thematic analysis on the refined data were extensively used. These were the identified vocabularies (I.D.) in random sizes:
        </p>
        <div id="word-cloud"></div>
        <script>
            const words = [
                'family', 'home', 'america', 'country', 'nation', 'unity', 'allies', 'alliance',
                'liberty', 'stand', 'victory', 'us', 'we', 'president', 'community', 'army',
                'national', 'united', 'unify', 'unification', 'american', 'freedom', 'government',
                'war', 'red', 'friends', 'friend', 'unified', 'together', 'unite'
            ];
    
            const wordArray = words.map(word => [word, Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 10]);
    
            WordCloud(document.getElementById('word-cloud'), { list: wordArray });
        </script>
        <p>The refined vocabularies were transformed into word graphs, where each node indicates a vocabulary and its size denotes its 
            relative frequency (larger nodes indicate higher frequency). The edges signify that there is certain correlation
            between the vocabularies, which was calculated by the cosine similarity between word vectors. The word vectors, which is the 
            representation of the words in a high-dimensional domain, was created using Google news corpus. High cosine similarity indicates a significant
            semantic similarity between the words. The colors of the nodes indicate the emotion conveyed in the vocabulary, which was
            identified using sentiment analysis - a Natural Language Processing technique - with a corpus of 124M Twitter data from 2018 to 2021. Blue indicates positive sentiment, red indicates negative sentiment,
            and gray indicates neutral sentiment.

        </div>
        <p>The figure above shows the percentage of frequency of I.D. from the total frequency of all extracted vocabularies. As it can be seen, the 
            percentages of I.D. in North Central newspapers had very small fluctuations, with 5.3% for 1940s and 5.1% for 1950s and 1960s. Underneath is the
            top-30 'polarized' (not neutral) vocabularies extracted for North Central newspapers of 1940s and 1960s, from left to right.

        </div>
        <p>From the left figure, it can immediately be seen that the vocabs "home" and "church" had the highest frequency. It can also be seen that during 1940s, North Central newspapers
            made an extensive use of very positive vocabularies, such as good, great, and best. The red, large node of "war" indicates that there were significant concerns
            of war during 1940s. The right figure of 1960s shows a deviated outcome. It can be detected that the North Central newspapers still used the words "home" and "church" and positive
            vocabularies such as "good" and "best". However, the frequency of the vocabulary "war" has decreased significantly, while the word with negative sentiment "discrimination" had been
            used more frequently. Based solely on the available data, it appears that North Central region was more focused on their intra-regional issues, reflecting the consistent 5% 
            frequency of I.D.

        <p>The table above shows the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, P-value for it, Spearman Correlation Coefficient, and P-value for it.
            As indicated by the first bar graph, no correlation has been detected, which is evident from the high P-values.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            Thus, we can conclude that for the North Central region, no significant relationship between the population of public administration and usage of vocabularies that foster a sense
            of unification have been found.

        <p>The figure above shows the percentage of frequency of I.D. from the total frequency of all extracted vocabularies for the Northeast region. As it can be seen, the 
            percentages of I.D. in Northeast newspapers increased from 3.9% to 4.2%, from 1940s to 1950s. The data for 1960s newspaper of Northeast region was inaccessible, and hence the analysis is to 
            be done only on that of 1940s and 1950s. Underneath is the
            top-30 'polarized' (not neutral) vocabularies extracted for the Northeast newspapers of 1940s and 1950s, from left to right.

        <p>From the left figure, it can immediately be seen that the vocabs "home" and "church" had the highest frequency, similar to the North Central region.
            The vocab "home" appearing in both regions to be one of the most frequently used word seems interesting: 
            this could be due the pure emphasis on "home" by the reporters, or just due to the advertisements in the newspaper. Hence "home" being included in the I.D. might be 
            deviating, which is more to be discussed in the Limitation section. Another similar trait to the North Central region is the frequent use of "war" in the early stages,
            and then disappers in the later stages. The word "segregation" has been added to the word graph, meaning that the Northeast
            region might have been experiencing identical issues of discrimination.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">In conclusion, a meaningful finding is merely impossible to be drawn due to insufficient data. However, the similarity between the two regions - the Northeast
            and the North Central - indicates that there did exist some degree of shared beliefs and common ideas between the U.S. citizens, regardless of the region.

        <p>The figure above shows the percentage of frequency of I.D. of the South region. It is clearly distinctive from the North Central 
            and the Northeast, as the percentage of I.D. clearly decreased from 4.3% to 2.9%, from 1940s to 1960s. Below is the 
            top-30 polarized vocabularies extracted for the South newspapers of 1940s and 1960s, from left to right.

        <p>Again, similar to other regions, it can be identified that the South newspapers made extensive use of the vocabs "home" and
            "church". Interstingly, compared to two regions above, the South newspapers made more use of the word "family", which could mean that there was
            stronger emphasis on the sense of inheritance (aligned with the term "business") and family values. The red colored nodes for the 
            words "methodist" and "children" seems to be errors within the NLP tool, which is to be discussed in detail in a later section.

        <p>The table above shows the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, P-value for it, Spearman Correlation Coefficient, and P-value for it.
            The Pearson Correlation Coefficient turned out to be statistically insignificant, which is evident from the high P-value. However, the
            concrete value of 0.0 for the Spearman P-value indicates a statistically significant correlation, and the value of -1.0 indicates that
            there is a strong negative monotonic relationship between the population of public adminstration and I.D. frequency in the South.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            We can conclude that for the South region, the intuitive hypothesis suggested in the introduction is rejected.
            The frequency of I.D. decreased, as the population of public administration increased.
