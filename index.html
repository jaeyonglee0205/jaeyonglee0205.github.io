            <p>This project aims to explore the usage of vocabularies that foster a sense of unification throughout the early stages of the Cold War.
                Specifically, it aims to answer the questions of whether the escalation of Cold War and the occupational distribution of the region was was reflected by the usage of vocabularies.
                Case studies will be conducted on the U.S. Census Bureau - designated regions, with both qualitative and quantitative analysis on the collected data, in order to assess the intuitive
                hypothesis that the sense of unification fostered by the newspaper will be reflected by the increase in number of people engaging in public administrations.
                This project will conclude with answers to above questions, as well as a compare-and-contrast to the answers provided by a generative AI.

        <p style="text-indent: 25px">The Cold War, starting from the 1947 and ending in 1991, is often regarded as the most pivotal moment of shaping the modern society. In the time of such heightened tension, unification among citizens is a critical factor,
            which is often fostered through media outlets such as newspapers. Particularly, the linguistic choices used in these newspapers was the major device for conveying messages, varying
            according to the demographic details of the region of publication. In want of 
            a closer inspection on whether the United States (U.S.) newspaper publications had adopted this method, 
            this project aims to explore and analyze the usage of vocabularies that foster a sense of unification and their regional differences, specifically the population engaged in public administration.
            The project hopes to determine methods used by the U.S. newspaper for intra-national connection throughout the early stages of Cold War.

        <p>The figures above show the occupational distribution of four regions, during 1940s. It can be seen that the distributions are distinct; Majority of people in the North Central and Northeast are engaged in
            Manufacturing, while people in the South were rather engaged in agriculture, while the West is more inclined towards wholesale and retail.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>The figures above show the occupational distribution of four regions during 1950s. The percentage of people engaged in manufacturing have been increased for the North Central and the Northeast, while more people are engaged in
            wholesale and retail in the South and the West. As 3 out of 4 regions (except the West) are having more percentage of people engaging in transportation-related occupations, the increase in wholesale and retail, and manufacturing
            could be due to the fact that more people have chosen to engage in jobs that are away from their location of living with the benefits of public transportation.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>The figures above show the occpational distribution of four regions during 1960s. For all regions, wholesale and retail related services as well as manufacturing related services have became the major occupation.
            It is interesting to see how the professional related jobs have also increased for all four reasons significantly, which could be due to the arms race between U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold War.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Government (Public Administration) Occupation</h3>

        </div>
        <p>It should be noted that the military related occupations constitute the majority of the public administration. From the figures, it can be seen that four all regions, the population of people engaging in public administration
            increased over time, rather in a linear manner. The West experienced the highest increase, with 37.2% from the 1940s to 1950s, and 33.5% from the 1950s to 1960s. The Northeastern was the least, with 24.2% and 16.1%. However, this could be
            due to the fact that the total population of public administration in the West is the smallest, leading to a small sample bias.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Important Getaways</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturing, wholesale and retail, agriculture, and professional related jobs constituted the majority of occupation from the 1940s to 1960s in the U.S.</li>
            <li>Population increase for some occpations could be due to the technological advancements, or the escalation of the Cold War.</li>
            <li>Population of people engaging in public administration increased in a linear manner for all regions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Analysis by Regions</h2>
        <p>For the analysis of each region, the optical character recognition (OCR, automated text transfer) generated U.S. newspapers published between 1940 and 1960, divided by the regions, were collected.
            The extracted vocabularies from the data were then filtered using Named Entity Recognition - which is extracting 'important' terms from linguistic strings - feature of SpaCy, an open-source Natural Language Processing tool. 
            For identifying the vocabularies that were used to foster a sense of unification, thesauruses as well as manual thematic analysis on the refined data were extensively used. These were the identified vocabularies (I.D.) in random sizes:
        </p>
        <div id="word-cloud"></div>
        <script>
            const words = [
                'family', 'home', 'america', 'country', 'nation', 'unity', 'allies', 'alliance',
                'liberty', 'stand', 'victory', 'us', 'we', 'president', 'community', 'army',
                'national', 'united', 'unify', 'unification', 'american', 'freedom', 'government',
                'war', 'red', 'friends', 'friend', 'unified', 'together', 'unite'
            ];
    
            const wordArray = words.map(word => [word, Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 10]);
    
            WordCloud(document.getElementById('word-cloud'), { list: wordArray });
        </script>
        <p>The refined vocabularies were transformed into word graphs, where each node indicates a vocabulary and its size denotes its 
            relative frequency (larger nodes indicate higher frequency). The edges signify that there is certain correlation
            between the vocabularies, which was calculated by the cosine similarity between word vectors. The word vectors, which is the 
            representation of the words in a high-dimensional domain, was created using Google news corpus. High cosine similarity indicates a significant
            semantic similarity between the words. The colors of the nodes indicate the emotion conveyed in the vocabulary, which was
            identified using sentiment analysis - a Natural Language Processing technique - with a corpus of 124M Twitter data from 2018 to 2021. Blue indicates positive sentiment, red indicates negative sentiment,
            and gray indicates neutral sentiment.

        <p>The figure above shows the percentage of frequency of I.D. from the total frequency of all extracted vocabularies. As it can be seen, the 
            percentages of I.D. in North Central newspapers had very small fluctuations, with 5.3% for 1940s and 5.1% for 1950s and 1960s. Underneath is the
            top-30 'polarized' (not neutral) vocabularies extracted for North Central newspapers of 1940s and 1960s, from left to right.

        </div>
        <p>From the left figure, it can immediately be seen that the vocabs "home" and "church" had the highest frequency. It can also be seen that during 1940s, North Central newspapers
            made an extensive use of very positive vocabularies, such as good, great, and best. The red, large node of "war" indicates that there were significant concerns
            of war during 1940s. The right figure of 1960s shows a deviated outcome. It can be detected that the North Central newspapers still used the words "home" and "church" and positive
            vocabularies such as "good" and "best". However, the frequency of the vocabulary "war" has decreased significantly, while the word with negative sentiment "discrimination" had been
            used more frequently. Based solely on the available data, it appears that North Central region was more focused on their intra-regional issues, reflecting the consistent 5% 
            frequency of I.D.

        <p>The table above shows the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, P-value for it, Spearman Correlation Coefficient, and P-value for it.
            As indicated by the first bar graph, no correlation has been detected, which is evident from the high P-values.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            Thus, it can be concluded that for the North Central region, no significant relationship between the population of public administration and usage of vocabularies that foster a sense
            of unification has been found.

        <p>The figure above shows the percentage of frequency of I.D. from the total frequency of all extracted vocabularies for the Northeast region. As it can be seen, the 
            percentages of I.D. in Northeast newspapers increased from 3.9% to 4.2%, from the 1940s to 1950s. The data for 1960s newspaper of Northeast region was inaccessible, and hence the analysis is to 
            be done only on that of 1940s and 1950s. Underneath is the
            top-30 'polarized' (not neutral) vocabularies extracted for the Northeast newspapers of 1940s and 1950s, from left to right.

        </div>
        <p>From the left figure, it can immediately be seen that the vocabs "home" and "church" had the highest frequency, similar to the North Central region.
            The vocab "home" appearing in both regions to be one of the most frequently used word seems interesting: 
            this could be due the pure emphasis on "home" by the reporters, or just due to the advertisements in the newspaper. Hence "home" being included in the I.D. might be 
            deviating, which is more to be discussed in the Limitation section. Another similar trait to the North Central region is the frequent use of "war" in the early stages,
            and then disappers in the later stages. The word "segregation" has been added to the word graph, meaning that the Northeast
            region might have been experiencing identical issues of discrimination.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">In conclusion, a meaningful finding is merely impossible to be drawn due to insufficient data. However, the similarity between the two regions - the Northeast
            and the North Central - indicates that there did exist some degree of shared beliefs and common ideas between the U.S. citizens, regardless of the region.

        <p>Again, similar to other regions, it can be identified that the South newspapers made extensive use of the vocabs "home" and
            "church". Interstingly, compared to two regions above, the South newspapers made more use of the word "family", which could mean that there was
            stronger emphasis on the sense of inheritance (aligned with the term "business") and family values. The term "business", however, does not seem to
            align with the occupation data visualized in above section - its frequency decreases, even though the population of people engaging in
            business (entrepreneurs) have increased over the years. The red colored nodes for the 
            words "methodist" and "children" seems to be errors within the NLP tool, which is to be discussed in detail in a later section.

            top-30 polarized vocabularies extracted for the West newspapers of 1940s and 1960s.

            largest share, this outcome could be due to the advertisements of retail products. Again, the term "war" was used frequently during

        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the project, the question of whether, and how the U.S. newspaper fostered a sense of unification was explored. 
            The occupation distribution of the regions of the U.S. from the 1940s to 1960s were visited, as well as the relevant historical newspapers transferred to textual data by the Library of Congress. 
            The era between the 1940s and 1960s was a moment of tension for the U.S. - they were largely convinced by the illusional ‘missile gap’ between them and the Soviet Union, and were shocked by the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. (Arms Race: Definition, Cold War & Nuclear Arms | HISTORY, 2009)
            However, the outcome of the analysis on the textual data failed to portray such context. Words related to this heightened tension, for example “missile”, or “cuba” couldn’t be identified. 
            The occupational distribution does show some kind of relationship to the tension, as the population of people engaging in public administration did increase. 
            Though, the provided context is insufficient for a concrete justification. 
            The analyzed correlation between the occupation distribution and the textual newspaper data were also rather insufficient for providing a concrete answer to the question.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nonetheless, the important getaway from the project is that the newspapers did show some traits of emphasis on specific concepts like “family” and “war”, supporting that they did promote a social, community-wise cohesion. 
            The differences of those specific concepts between regions visualized throughout the project indicate that the U.S. newspapers influenced and were influenced by the local issues from the 1940s to 1960s. 
            This indirectly demonstrates their contribution to fostering a sense of unification and creating ‘shared beliefs’ in low-level contexts.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Compare-and-Contrast to Generative AI</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Below is the answer from ChatGPT 4o, when asked with the main question of this project. 
            Results of compare-and-contrast are marked in blue, red, or gray italic, indicating an agreement, a disagreement, or inclusive, respectively.</p>
        <p>During the early stages of the Cold War (1940-1960), U.S. newspaper publications played a significant role in fostering a sense of unity across different regions. This period saw a concerted effort to align public sentiment and create a cohesive national identity in the face of perceived external threats from the Soviet Union. Here are some key ways in which newspapers accomplished this, especially in relation to the regional population engaged in public administration:
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1. Promotion of National Security Narrative</span><br>
            Newspapers widely disseminated the idea that national security was paramount. This narrative emphasized the threats posed by communism and the Soviet Union, promoting policies and actions that were deemed necessary to protect the nation. Public administrators were often depicted as key players in the defense of American values and interests, reinforcing their role in the collective effort.
            <br>
            <span style="color: #3498DB">
                This somewhat agrees to the findings from the project. The words "president" and "government" were frequently used in 
                various regions, aligned with the fact that the population of public administration increased in all regions throughout the years.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">2. Coverage of National Policies and Programs</span><br>
            Newspapers provided extensive coverage of national policies and programs related to the Cold War, such as the Marshall Plan, NATO, and domestic anti-communist measures. By highlighting these initiatives, newspapers fostered a sense of collective participation and support across regions. This coverage often included the roles and contributions of local public administrators, showcasing their importance in the national framework.
            <br>
            <span style="color: #EC7063">
                This argument deviates from the outcomes of the analysis. Terms related to the Cold War, for example "Marshall Plan" and "Nato" were rarely found to be frequently used in the newspapers.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">3. Editorials and Opinion Pieces</span><br>
            Editorials and opinion pieces frequently stressed the importance of unity and patriotic duty. They called for citizens and public officials alike to support the government's efforts in combating the communist threat. These writings aimed to unify readers by appealing to shared values and national pride.
            <br>
            <span style="font-style:italic">
                This argument remains inconclusive, as the high-level contents such as editorials were not visited in this project. 
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">4. Localizing National Issues</span><br>
            Newspapers localized national issues by reporting on how Cold War policies affected local communities and public administration. This helped readers relate national events to their own lives and understand the local impact of global events. For instance, the establishment of military bases or defense industries in various regions was highlighted, demonstrating the interconnectedness of local and national interests.
            <br>
            <span style="color: #EC7063">
                This argument deviates from the analysis. Again, terms related to specific contexts of the military were not identified.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">5. Highlighting Regional Contributions</span><br>
            Articles often celebrated regional contributions to the national defense effort, such as local industries producing military supplies or regional universities conducting important research. This recognition fostered a sense of pride and unity among readers, showing that every part of the country played a vital role in the national endeavor.
            <br>
            <span style="color: #EC7063">
                This argument deviates from the analysis. It was unable to determine the sense of pride from the available data. The word 'often' indicates that, regardless of the project, this is a very weak argument if not supplemented by relevant data.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">6. Communicating Government Directives</span><br>
            During the Cold War, newspapers served as a conduit for government communications, including directives and messages from public officials. By regularly featuring statements and policies from national and regional leaders, newspapers helped align public opinion with governmental objectives. Public administrators were often the face of these communications, reinforcing their connection to the broader national mission.
            <br>
            <span style="color: #3498DB">
                This somewhat agrees to the findings from the project. Again, the words "president" and "government" were frequently used in 
                various regions. This could be due to the newspapers reporting the speeches, messages, and actions of government officials, in order to
                create connection between citizens.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">7. Campaigns Against Subversion</span><br>
            Newspapers played a key role in anti-communist campaigns, often in collaboration with public officials. They reported on investigations, trials, and the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). This coverage underscored the vigilance needed to protect the nation, portraying public administrators as defenders of American democracy against internal subversion.
            <br>
            <span style="font-style:italic">
                This argument remains inconclusive, as the high-level contents of the newspaper such as reports of investigations were not visited in this project. Only the low-level linguistic forms were studied and analyzed, due to time and resource constraints.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">8. Patriotic Symbolism and Messaging</span><br>
            Patriotic symbols and messaging were ubiquitous in newspapers, with frequent references to American values, freedom, and democracy. These elements were used to foster a shared national identity and rally support for Cold War policies. Public administrators were often featured in contexts that emphasized their dedication to these ideals.
            <br>
            <span style="color: #3498DB">
                This somewhat agrees to the findings from the project. The word "freedom" was found to be frequently used in some regions, at specific era. This could be due
                to the newspapers' emphasis on American values in order to create a stronger national community.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Conclusion</span><br>
            Through these various strategies, U.S. newspaper publications effectively fostered a sense of unity during the early stages of the Cold War. By aligning regional populations with national narratives and highlighting the roles of public administrators, newspapers helped create a cohesive front against the perceived communist threat. This unity was essential for maintaining public support for government policies and ensuring a coordinated national response to Cold War challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <span style="color: #EC7063">
                This argument deviates from the conclusion. In fact, the question of whether the U.S. newspaper publications 'effectively' fostered a sense of
                unity still remains as a question. However, the answer from the generative AI hints that the analysis on high-level contexts is equally important in
                historical analysis, which would require exceptional effort but provide qualitative evidences for a stronger conclusion.

        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Limitations and Future Works</h2>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Limitations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Small sample bias due to the relatively small dataset might have made the conclusions in this project to be highly
                vulnerable to the outliers or irrelevant data. This would have made the statistical analysis, such as Pearson Correlation, to be 
                rather irrelevant.
            </li>
            <li>
                The vocabularies were analyzed without context, that is, the function of each vocabularies were not identified, due to difficulties in 
                acquiring the suitable data for such analysis, which would limit the justification of the conclusions. For example, the words used in advertisements, such as "big" or "good" might
                have blurred the core correlation between datasets.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bias from the scope of data might have affected the conclusion. The newspapers were collected by regions, though the data provided by 
                Library of Congress seemed to be focused on specific states, rather than the U.S. Census regions, limiting the generalization of the conclusion.
            </li>
            <li>
                Errors within sentiment analysis do exist, as the corpus was composed of Tweets. The term 'children' being identified as a negative word 
                might have resulted from tweets regarding crimes on children, which is often rapidly shared on social network services.
            </li>
            <li>
                The analysis was based on the frequency of the words, meaning that 'critical' words that directly mention a particular event in the Cold War, for example
                the Cuban Missile Crisis, might have been blurred by the constantly and repetitively used words like "church".
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Future works:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There seems to be a significant correlation between regions on their shared beliefs. Upon analyzing the vocabularies used in newspapers,
                similar words appeared. Diversifying the regions and studying the linguistic similarity between them might have been intersting.
            </li>
            <li>
                Similarly, there seems to be a significant relationship between the U.S. citizens and religion, 
                as the term "church" was the most frequently used term
                overall, across all regions. Conducting a study on effect of religion on U.S. citizens by using newspapers might have been interesting.
            </li>
