            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This project aims to explore the usage of vocabularies that foster a sense of unification throughout the early stages of the Cold War.
                Specifically, it aims to answer the questions of whether the escalation of Cold War and the occupational distribution of the region was was reflected by the usage of vocabularies.
                Case studies will be conducted on the U.S. Census Bureau - designated regions, with both qualitative and quantitative analysis on the collected data.
                This project will conclude with answers to above questions, as well as a compare-and-contrast to the answers provided by a generative AI.

        <p style="text-indent: 25px">The Cold War, starting from 1947 and ending in 1991, is often regarded as the most pivotal moment of shaping the modern society. In the time of such heightened tension, unification among citizens is a critical factor,
            which is often fostered through media outlets such as newspapers. Particularly, the linguistic choices used in these newspapers was the major device for conveying messages, varying
            according to the demographic details of the region of publication. In want of 
            a closer inspection on whether the United States (U.S.) newspaper publications had adopted this method, this project aims to explore and analyze the usage of vocabularies that foster a sense of unification and their regional differences.
            The project hopes to determine methods used by the U.S. newspaper for intra-national connection throughout the early stages of Cold War.

        <h2>Analysis by Regions</h2>
        <p>For the analysis of the regions, the optical character recognition (OCR, automated text transfer) generated U.S. newspapers published between 1940 and 1960, divided by the regions, were collected.
            The extracted vocabularies from the data were then filtered using Named Entity Recognition - which is extracting 'important' terms from linguistic strings - feature of SpaCy, an open-source Natural Language Processing tool. 
            For identifying the vocabularies that were used to foster a sense of unification, thesauruses as well as manual thematic analysis on the refined data were extensively used. These were the identified vocabularies (in random sizes):
        </p>
        <div id="word-cloud"></div>
        <script>
            const words = [
                'family', 'home', 'america', 'country', 'nation', 'unity', 'allies', 'alliance',
                'liberty', 'stand', 'victory', 'us', 'we', 'president', 'community', 'army',
                'national', 'united', 'unify', 'unification', 'american', 'freedom', 'government',
                'war', 'red', 'friends', 'friend', 'unified', 'together', 'unite'
            ];
    
            const wordArray = words.map(word => [word, Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 10]);
    
            WordCloud(document.getElementById('word-cloud'), { list: wordArray });
        </script>
        <p>The refined vocabularies were transformed into word graphs, where each node indicates a vocabulary and its size denotes its 
            relative frequency (larger nodes indicate higher frequency). The edges signify that there is certain correlation
            between the vocabularies, which was calculated by the cosine similarity between word vectors. The word vectors, which is the 
            representation of the words in a high-dimensional domain, was created using Google news corpus. High cosine similarity indicates a significant
            semantic similarity between the words.
